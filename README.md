# Serverless Boilerplate Template

This repository is a collection of serverless boilerplate templates designed to expedite the process of starting new projects. It serves as a convenient resource for developers who frequently work on serverless architectures. At first, when I start using serverless, there's quite a things that need to configure, hence this boilerplate template comes in. 

You might have different ways to structurized and naming the folder and that is totally fine and okay :). 

But this is the structure that I think the most easy for me to start a project.

## Instructions

For utilities and clients, I divide it into different folder (see clients and utilities folder) so that you will be able to choose on what kind of clients or utilities that you need. I'll add in the utils that I commonly used.
Please remember to install the necessary package when you copy the utilities and clients.

For utitlies, You can copy and paste the according file either in typescript or normal javascript and put it inside the `utilities/utils` folder under `src` folder.

While for clients, I would suggest you to put under `src` folder, named `clients` folder

Bear in mind that the clients and utilities might not be complete and cover all the use case.

Feel free to make a pull request to improve the clients or utilities!
